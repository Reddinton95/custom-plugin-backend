# Learn Backend Development

Start your backend development learning journey with the custom-plugin-backend system.

## Getting Started

The system is organized into 7 sequential agents covering the complete backend development roadmap:

1. **Programming Fundamentals** (8 weeks) - Languages, Git, package management
2. **Database Management** (10 weeks) - SQL, NoSQL, optimization
3. **API Development** (16 weeks) - REST, GraphQL, gRPC, security
4. **Architecture & Design Patterns** (14 weeks) - SOLID, patterns, microservices
5. **Caching & Performance** (8 weeks) - Caching, scaling, monitoring
6. **DevOps & Infrastructure** (12 weeks) - Docker, K8s, CI/CD
7. **Testing, Security & Monitoring** (12 weeks) - Testing, security, compliance

## Learning Paths

### Fast Track (16 weeks)
For experienced developers who want to quickly learn modern backend:
- Start with Agent 1 (skip if you know programming)
- Go to Agent 3 (API Development)
- Jump to Agent 6 (DevOps)

### Full-Stack Developer (20 weeks)
Complete web application development:
- Agent 1 → Agent 2 → Agent 3 → Agent 6

### Microservices Architect (28 weeks)
Distributed systems and architecture:
- All agents 1-7

### DevOps Engineer (24 weeks)
Infrastructure and deployment focus:
- Agents 1, 2, 5, 6, 7

### Comprehensive Path (36 weeks)
Complete mastery of all domains:
- All agents 1-7 sequentially

## Choosing Your Path

**Are you new to programming?**
→ Start with **Agent 1: Programming Fundamentals**

**Have 1+ years programming experience?**
→ Consider **Agent 3: API Development** or your specific goal

**Want to build complete backends?**
→ **Full-Stack Developer Path** (20 weeks)

**Interested in large-scale systems?**
→ **Microservices Architect Path** (28 weeks)

**Focus on infrastructure/deployment?**
→ **DevOps Engineer Path** (24 weeks)

## Each Agent Includes

- **Comprehensive skill modules** with theory and practice
- **50+ hands-on projects** with clear requirements
- **1000+ code examples** in multiple languages
- **Best practices** from industry standards
- **Assessment criteria** to verify mastery
- **Related resources** for deeper learning

## Time Commitment

- **Fast Track**: 8-10 hours/week for 16 weeks
- **Full-Stack**: 7-8 hours/week for 20 weeks
- **Microservices**: 7-8 hours/week for 28 weeks
- **DevOps**: 8-10 hours/week for 24 weeks
- **Comprehensive**: 7-8 hours/week for 36 weeks
