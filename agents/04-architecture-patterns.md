# Architecture & Design Patterns

## Overview

Agent 4 teaches system design and patterns by helping you:
- Apply SOLID principles to code design
- Use design patterns appropriately
- Design microservices architectures
- Build event-driven systems
- Make architectural decisions

**Duration**: 14 weeks | **Learning Hours**: 140+ | **Skills**: 4 | **Projects**: 6

## Capabilities

This agent specializes in:
- **SOLID Principles**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
- **Design Patterns**: 23 Gang of Four patterns across creational, structural, and behavioral categories
- **Microservices**: Service decomposition, communication, data management, deployment
- **Event-Driven**: Event notification, CQRS, Event Sourcing, message queues
- **Architecture**: Monolithic vs distributed, scalability, resilience patterns

## When to Use This Agent

Invoke this agent when you need to:
- Refactor code for better design
- Choose appropriate design patterns
- Design microservices architecture
- Implement event-driven systems
- Make architectural decisions
- Improve code maintainability
- Design for scalability
- Understand trade-offs

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: SOLID Principles (Weeks 1-3)
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open/Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle

### Phase 2: Design Patterns (Weeks 4-7)
- 5 Creational Patterns
- 7 Structural Patterns
- 11 Behavioral Patterns
- Pattern selection and trade-offs

### Phase 3: Microservices (Weeks 8-11)
- Service decomposition
- Communication patterns (REST, gRPC, messaging)
- Data management and consistency
- Service discovery and resilience
- Deployment patterns

### Phase 4: Event-Driven & CQRS (Weeks 12-14)
- Event-driven architecture
- CQRS pattern
- Event Sourcing
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Eventual consistency handling

## Skills Covered

### Skill 1: SOLID Principles
- Detailed explanation of all 5 principles
- Code examples showing bad and good practices
- Real-world scenarios for each principle
- Anti-patterns and violations
- Combined SOLID example

### Skill 2: Design Patterns
- Creational: Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype
- Structural: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy
- Behavioral: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor
- Pattern selection matrix
- When and when not to use each

### Skill 3: Microservices Architecture
- Service decomposition strategies
- Communication patterns: REST, gRPC, messaging
- Data management: database per service, Saga, CQRS
- Service discovery: client-side and server-side
- API Gateway patterns
- Resilience patterns: circuit breaker, retry, fallback

### Skill 4: Event-Driven & CQRS
- Event-Driven Architecture fundamentals
- Event patterns: notification, state transfer, sourcing
- CQRS pattern with implementation
- Event Sourcing for audit trails
- Saga pattern (choreography vs orchestration)
- Message queues: RabbitMQ, Kafka, SQS
