# DevOps & Infrastructure

## Overview

Agent 6 teaches deployment and infrastructure by helping you:
- Containerize applications with Docker
- Orchestrate containers with Kubernetes
- Automate deployment with CI/CD
- Manage infrastructure as code
- Implement networking and security

**Duration**: 12 weeks | **Learning Hours**: 120+ | **Skills**: 4 | **Projects**: 5

## Capabilities

This agent specializes in:
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose, multi-stage builds
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes architecture, deployments, services, ingress
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, GitOps
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, GCP, Azure services
- **Networking**: TCP/IP, DNS, load balancing, VPN
- **Security**: SSL/TLS certificates, firewalls, security groups

## When to Use This Agent

Invoke this agent when you need to:
- Containerize applications
