# System Architecture

This skill teaches designing robust, scalable backend systems.

## Quick Start

System architecture involves:
- **Design principles**: SOLID, clean code, DDD
- **Patterns**: Established solutions to recurring problems
- **Architecture styles**: Monolithic, microservices, event-driven
- **Trade-offs**: Scalability vs complexity, consistency vs availability

## Core Concepts

### SOLID Principles
- Single Responsibility
- Open/Closed
- Liskov Substitution
- Interface Segregation
- Dependency Inversion

### Design Patterns
- **Creational**: Singleton, Factory, Builder
- **Structural**: Adapter, Decorator, Facade
- **Behavioral**: Observer, Strategy, Command

### Architecture Styles
- **Monolithic**: Single codebase, simple but harder to scale
- **Microservices**: Independent services, more complex but scalable
- **Event-Driven**: Services communicate via events, loose coupling

## Key Topics

- Microservice decomposition
- Service communication patterns
- Data consistency and sagas
- Circuit breakers and resilience
- API gateways
- Service discovery
- Event sourcing and CQRS

## Hands-On Projects

- Refactor code with SOLID
- Implement design patterns
- Decompose into microservices
- Build event-sourced system
- Design API gateway
