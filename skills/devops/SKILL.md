# DevOps & Infrastructure

This skill teaches deploying and managing backend systems.

## Quick Start

DevOps involves:
- **Containerization**: Package applications with dependencies
- **Orchestration**: Manage multiple containers
- **Automation**: CI/CD pipelines for deployment
- **Infrastructure**: Define resources as code
- **Operations**: Monitor and maintain systems

## Key Concepts

### Containerization
- Docker images and containers
- Dockerfile best practices
- Multi-stage builds
- Image optimization

### Kubernetes
- Pods, deployments, services
- Ingress for routing
- ConfigMaps and secrets
- StatefulSets, DaemonSets

### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins
- Automated testing
- Container image building
- Deployment automation

### Infrastructure as Code
- Terraform for provisioning
- Ansible for configuration
- CloudFormation (AWS)
- Idempotent operations

### Cloud Platforms
- AWS (EC2, ECS, EKS, Lambda, RDS)
- GCP (Compute Engine, GKE, Cloud Functions)
- Azure (VMs, AKS, Functions)

## Networking & Security
- TCP/IP and OSI model
- DNS and domains
- SSL/TLS certificates
- Firewalls and security groups
- Load balancing

## Hands-On Projects

- Create Docker container
- Deploy to Kubernetes
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Write Terraform code
- Configure cloud resources
