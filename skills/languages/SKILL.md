# Programming Languages

This skill helps you select and master a programming language for backend development.

## Quick Start

Choosing a backend language depends on:
- **Project requirements** (performance, scalability, domain)
- **Team expertise** (existing knowledge, hiring market)
- **Ecosystem** (frameworks, libraries, community)
- **Performance needs** (compiled vs interpreted)

## Recommended Languages

### Personal Recommendations
**JavaScript/Node.js** and **Go** are highlighted as personal recommendations on roadmap.sh

### Alternative Options
Python, Java, C#, PHP, Ruby (each with specific strengths)

### Emerging
Rust (performance and safety)

## Learning Focus

Each language covers:
- Basic syntax and semantics
- Standard library
- Object-oriented and functional programming
- Package management
- Common frameworks for backends
